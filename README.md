# FAKE PROFILE DETECTION IN INSTAGRAM USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS 
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning-based system for the detection and classificationof fake profiles in Instagram.
Machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Principal Component Analysis, SupportVector Machines are trained and evaluated to identify between genuine and fake profiles
Model performance is assessed using a range of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
The project wants to make a strong and flexible way to reduce the number of fake profiles online, focusing oncontinuously improving by adapting various methods.
